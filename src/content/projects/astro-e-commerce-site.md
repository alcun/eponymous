In this project, we tackle the challenge of building an e-commerce site with Astro. The key objective is to leverage Astro's static site generation for product pages, ensuring that the site remains fast and scalable as the product catalog grows. We explore integrating dynamic elements such as cart functionality and customer reviews, all while maintaining the site's performance and SEO-friendliness. This project serves as a testament to the flexibility and power of Astro for building complex, dynamic web applications.
