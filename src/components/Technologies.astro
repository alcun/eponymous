  <p>With any project, pragmatism is the name of the game and any tool is up for consideration if it is the right fit.</p>
  <p>That being said, the following is a list of tools I am familiar with and will tend to reach for:</p>
  <ul>
    {technologies.map(tech => (
      <li>
        <strong>{tech.label}</strong> 
      </li>
    ))}
